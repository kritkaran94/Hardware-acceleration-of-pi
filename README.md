<b>Hardware acceleration through OpenGL ES 2.0 </b>

Make VisPy work on the Raspberry Pi:


1.) Used some of the ideas developed in the Kivy project. This involved slightly more complex hardware-software      interface work, although the Pi's support of OpenGL ES 2.0 made this tractable for a summer project.

2.) Used the Pi3d module as well and tried to minimise the dependecy of VisPy on it.

Project Status :  Completion Level 80%

-----------------------------

Left In between due to Summer Internship at CBIX India 2015 and due to an unsuccessful application for VisPy during GSOC 2015. 


Though, the effort was appreciated by mentors Cyrille Rossant and Almer Klien.
